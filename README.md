Basically, I filed off the serial number and removed the bits I didn't like. This simulates a 23.4 degree axial tilt to Kerbin by tilting the rest of the system. It's built for JNSQ compatibility. If you want to use it with the stock system, or 6.4x Kerbin, then I'd recommend going with Stevehead's original mod:

it's still compatible with KSP through at least 1.7.2.

I don't know what other impacts it will have on difficulty, and it might break saves. Use at your own risk, and I highly recommend firing this up in its own game instance.

Changes Made:
- Removed remotetech config
- Removed repositioning of KSC
- Removed mass tweak to Jool from main config file and renamed to PSAHSSKopernicus.cfg
- Replaced MiniAVC version file with my own
