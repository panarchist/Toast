Credit to user "stevehead", who created the original configs before I mangled them.

Basically, I filed off the serial number and removed the bits I didn't like. This simulates a 23.4 degree axial tilt to Kerbin by tilting the rest of the system. It has OPM compatibility. I don't know what other impacts it will have on difficulty, and it might break saves. Use at your own risk, and I highly recommend firing this up in its own game instance.

Changes Made:
- Removed remotetech config
- Removed mass tweak to Sarnus, Urlum, and Neidon from the OuterPlanetsMod config file
- Removed mass tweak to Jool from main config file and renamed to PSAHSSKopernicus.cfg
- Replaced MiniAVC version file with my own

Compatibility:
- GPP Secondary (Galileo's Planet Pack) - modifies orbit of Ciro (GPP Primary)
- OPM (Outer Planets Mod) - Fully compatible, modifies orbits of the outer planets and moons to align with the modified stock system orbits
- Extrasolar - modifies orbit of Valentine
